# Unsupervised Road Parsing
Road parsing in UAV imagery traditionally relied on supervised learning, constrained by the necessity for manual annotations. Unsupervised semantic segmentation breaks out of this limitation, but is still a very challenging task for remote sensing images. This paper introduce unsupervised semantic segmentation for road scene in UAV imagery, combining the clustering algorithm and state-of-the-art foundation models. Following evaluation on real-world high-resolution road images collected by UAVs, the proposed method shows highly promising segmentation accuracy, moreover demonstrating the potential of open-set semantic segmentation. With minimal demands for manual annotations and computational resources, the proposed approach exhibits significant potential for practical applications.
